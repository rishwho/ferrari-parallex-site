            <h1>SF90 XX STRADALE</h1>
            <p>The Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale is the most extreme expression of Ferrari's road-legal performance to date. It is the first time a car from the exclusive "XX Programme"—traditionally reserved for track-only developmental prototypes—has been made street-legal.</p>

            <h2>Performance</h2>
            <p>The SF90 XX Stradale was engineered to bridge the gap between a GT car and a dedicated race car. It is not just about speed; it is about absolute efficiency.

Speed Metrics: It rockets from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 2.3 seconds and reaches 200 km/h (124 mph) in a staggering 6.5 seconds.

Fiorano Benchmark: It set a record lap time at Ferrari's Fiorano circuit of 1:17.309, making it the fastest road car in the brand’s history at that track.

Extra Boost Logic: A new software feature called "Extra Boost" provides short bursts of maximum power at the exit of corners, a technology derived directly from Formula 1.</p>
